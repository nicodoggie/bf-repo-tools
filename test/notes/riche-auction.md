Rosemunda Parvese had always wanted to be able sell off her validated piece of Riche armor. She had no real interest in memorabilia from pre-revolutionary Estrega, especially not any kind of military equipment. What had drawn her to such a piece in the first place was that it was used as collateral by a gambling addict in one of her casinos. The man lost 25.000 gold pieces during that stint, and was forced to forfeit the armor due to an inability to pay. It would take a DC 20 Persuasion (Charisma) check to convince her to disclose the fact that the person who owes her money was \[character:156\], a recently deceased councilor of \[location:97\], and that she suspects that \[character:304\] had something to do with his death.

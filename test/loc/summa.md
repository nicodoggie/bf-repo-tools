The Banate of Summa is bordered on the north by the \[location:319\] which were formed from the snowmelt from the mountains of \[location:316\]. These waters, lead into a number of streams, that eventually merge into the \[location:320\] that meanders into Summa's south western coastline via the Mazza Delta, which also leads into the \[location:318\]. The mineral-rich headwaters have ensured that the farmlands of Summa are very productive, which in turn ensures the wealth of the Summan Ban, and their inhabitants.

When the \[event:103\] had occurred, the Ban had ordered the border closed to the refugees, especially ensuring that those who are touched by the Devil-sight, people with yellow eyes which are an indication of potential magical ability, are barred entry. Those who are "touched" born within their borders are moved into internment camps, and trained to be enforcers of the Ban's will.

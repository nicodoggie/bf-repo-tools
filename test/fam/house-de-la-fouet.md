The de la Fouet family were once a prominent Sanerian house, and offshoot of the House of Trevallier. The split occurred when Regatto Trevallier, second son of Antoine Trevallier converted to \[organisation:79| Divine Masochism\]. Antoine threatened to disinherit Regatto, who instead preemptively sued for his inheritance.

The de la Fouet family were staunch supporters of the Apgarian Revolution. Members of the family were considered heroes of the \[event:80\].

Today, only two members of the illustrious family remain:
